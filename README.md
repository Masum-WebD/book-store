## About BookStore Project

The main purpose of the project is to create a bookstore that supports users to search and purchase a book based on title, author, and subject. The preference books are displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their books online through credit card payment. Users can read any kind of book in our book category online after he/she pays the payment of the book. The Administrator will have extra functionalities when balanced to the common user.
The reason to create this project has many roots,

* On Bookstore is an online web application where the customer can purchase books online. 
* Through a web browser, the customers can search for a book by its title, later can add   to the shopping cart and finally purchase using a credit card transaction.
* The user can login using their account details or new customers can set up an account very quickly.
* They should give the details of their name, contact number, and shipping address.
* The user can also give feedback to a book by giving ratings on a score of five and doing comments.
* The books are divided into many categories based on subjects like Poems, Novels, Drama, History, Research, Science fiction etc.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
